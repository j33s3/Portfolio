                    <b>Hello!</b> My name is Jesse Peterson, and I was born and raised in the greater Seattle area.
                    I attended Lake Washington Institute of Technology for high school.
                    I finished high school with my Associates in Computer Science.
                    From here I attended Southern New Hampshire University to further obtain my Bachelors of Computer
                    Science.

                    I am currently working towards my goals of becoming a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b> or
                    <b>Site-Reliability Engineer</b>.
                    I love to take on challenges that further my knowledge in Computer Science.
                    Feel free to check out any of my projects on this websiteâ€”I'm always excited to share my work!
