I attended Lake Washington Institute of Technology for high school. I finished high school with my Associates in Computer Science. From here I attended Southern New Hampshire University to further obtain my Bachelors of Computer Science. I am currently working towards my goals of becoming a Full-Stack Developer or Site-Reliability Engineer. I love to take on challenges that further my knowledge in Computer Science. Feel free to check out any of my projects on this websiteâ€”I'm always excited to share my work!"></p>
